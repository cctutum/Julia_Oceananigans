# Fluid Dynamics with Oceananigans

The Oceananigans package is an excellent choice for fluid dynamics simulations focused on ocean physics. As the name suggests, it is specifically designed to model the complex physical processes at play in the ocean environment. Oceananigans provides a flexible simulation construction kit that can incorporate the effects of temperature and salinity variations, the Earth's rotation, wind, and other relevant factors.

The package's default settings are well-tuned and often perform admirably, but Oceananigans also offers the user a high degree of customization. Users can specify from several available solution methods to best suit their particular simulation needs. Additionally, Oceananigans comes pre-equipped with various physics models, including a linear equation of state, while also allowing users to easily substitute alternative models of their own design.
