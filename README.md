# Fluid Dynamics with Oceananigans

The Oceananigans package in Julia SciML ecosystem is an excellent choice for fluid dynamics simulations focused on ocean physics. As the name suggests, it is specifically designed to model the complex physical processes at play in the ocean environment. Oceananigans provides a flexible simulation construction kit that can incorporate the effects of temperature and salinity variations, the Earth's rotation, wind, and other relevant factors.

The package's default settings are well-tuned and often perform admirably, but Oceananigans also offers the user a high degree of customization. Users can specify from several available solution methods to best suit their particular simulation needs. Additionally, Oceananigans comes pre-equipped with various physics models, including a linear equation of state, while also allowing users to easily substitute alternative models of their own design.

The system under observation exhibits the phenomenon known as turbulent convection. This regime is characterized by the intriguing emergence of large-scale order from an underlying state of apparent randomness. What is particularly fascinating is the persistent coexistence of this large-scale order with the turbulent flow that pervades the system.
The interplay between the organized, structured patterns that arise and the chaotic, turbulent nature of the flow presents an intriguing dynamic to observe and study. This delicate balance between order and disorder, between coherence and chaos, is a hallmark of turbulent convection and offers valuable insights into the complex behaviors that can arise in fluid systems.
Observing and analyzing this regime provides a window into the rich and multifaceted nature of fluid dynamics, where the seemingly random and disorderly can give rise to striking organizational structures that persist amidst the turbulence. This interplay between order and chaos is a captivating area of study that continues to yield new discoveries and deepen our understanding of the fundamental principles governing fluid systems.
